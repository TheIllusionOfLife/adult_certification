# Adult Certification (大人免許)

> "School didn't teach you this, but ignorance will kill you."

**Adult Certification** is a satirical dystopian adventure game where you are judged by an AI named **Unit 0-ADULT**. You must survive a series of "adult literacy" tests covering finance, law, and social etiquette to earn your place in society—or be recycled as a biological processor.

## 🎮 Game Concepts

-   **Educational Dystopia**: Learn about taxes, labor laws, and contracts through a lens of dark humor and survival.
-   **3-Axis Status System**: Balance **Credit Score (CS)**, **Money**, and **Sanity**. Failing any leads to Game Over.
-   **Skill System**: Acquire abilities like "Tax Hacker", "Iron Stomach", or "Logic Bomb" to navigate the unfair system.
-   **Multiple Endings**: From "Perfect Cog" (S Rank) to "Industrial Waste" (F Rank), your fate depends on your score and choices.
