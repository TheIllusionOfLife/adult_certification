# Product Overview

## 🎯 Purpose (Elevator Pitch)
**License to Adult** is a "Educational Dystopia" adventure game where an AI judges your worthiness to be a member of society. It exposes the "reality school didn't teach you"—taxes, contracts, labor laws—by gamifying them into a survival horror simulation.
Players must survive the scrutiny of "Unit 0-ADULT", ensuring they become "Certified Adults" rather than "Biological Processors".

## 👥 Target Users
-   **Primary**: Young Adults (20s-30s) entering the workforce. People who vent on social media "Why didn't school teach me taxes?".
-   **Secondary**: Gamers who enjoy dark, satirical atmospheres (e.g., *Papers, Please*, *Fallout*, *Paranoia*).
-   **Value Proposition**: Learn essential "Self-Defense Literacy" (financial/legal/social) while enjoying a cynical narrative.

## ✨ Key Features
1.  **3-Axis Status Management**: 
    -   **Credit Score (CS)**: Social credibility.
    -   **Asset**: Survival funds.
    -   **Autonomy**: Mental health.
    -   *Mechanic*: A dilemma engine where gaining one often costs another.
2.  **Asset Inspection**: Spotting "traps" in contract images or "irregularities" in invoices (generated by AI).
3.  **Skill System**: Unlocking passive buffs (e.g., "Tax Hacker") to build a survival strategy.
4.  **Adaptive Difficulty**: The AI monitors your weak points (e.g., specific weakness to Finance questions) and adjusts content.

## 💼 Business Objectives
-   **Viral Engagement**: Shareable "Adult Rank" results (S to F) designed for social media showing.
-   **Educational Impact**: Visualizing "Ignorance" as a fatal flaw in a high-stakes environment.
-   **Scalability**: A framework designed to easily add new "Question Packs" (e.g., Real Estate DLC, Freelance Tax DLC).

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
-   **Dark Cartoon**: Menacing but cute. Rubber-hose animation style.
-   **Mood**: Oppressive, Bureaucratic, Cynical.
-   **UI**: Diegetic elements mixed with "glitchy" overlays representing the AI's instability.
